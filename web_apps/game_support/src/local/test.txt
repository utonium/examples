    
Coding Challenge 
For your coding challenge, you will create and customer support system for a fictional online game.
 
Our fictional battle game is played online by many players.  Each player has following profile attributes:
    1. First Name
    2. Last Name
    3. Nickname
    4. Wins
    5. Losses
    6. Current Win Streak
    7. Created
    8. Last Seen
 
Your mission
Mission I, Design and implement REST API for following specs:
    REQUIREMENT: All API requests MUST BE authenticated using simple username/password authentication.
 
    Create User
        POST    /users
        parameters:             //Content-Type: application/json
            {
                “first”: <first_name>,
                “last”: <last_name>,
                “nickname”: <nickname>
   }
    response:
   //Content-Type: application/json
   {
        “error”: false,             //success
        “time”: <timestamp>,
        “userid”: <userid>          
   }
            {
                “error”: true,              //failure
                “time”: <timestamp>,
                “msg”: <error_description>
   }
Modify User
PUT  /users/<userid>
        parameters:
        //Content-Type: application/json
        {
            “field”: <field_being_modified>,
            “value”: <new_value>
   }
   response:
            //Content-Type: application/json
            {
                “error”: false,                 //success
                “time”: <timestamp>
   }
   {
    “error”: true,                  //failure
       “time”: <timestamp>,
       “msg”: <error_description>
   }
    
    Create Battle Log
        POST /battles
        parameters:
            //Content-Type: application/json
            {
                “attacker”: <attacker_userid>,
                “defender”: <defender_userid>,
                “winner”: <winner_userid>,
                “start”: <battle_start_time>,
                “end”: <battle_end_time>
  }
  response:
        //Content-Type: application/json
           {
                “error”: false,                 //success
                “time”: <timestamp>
  }
  {
    “error”: true,                  //failure
      “time”: <timestamp>,
      “msg”: <error_description>
    }
 
Mission II, Design and implement web application, which reports player data according to following specs:
    /users/<userid>
    •   Show user profile data listed above
 
    /users/search?nickname=<nickname>
    •   Find user by nickname
    •   redirect to /users/<userid> URL for the user(s) found by search
 
    /battles?start=<starttime>&end=<endtime>
    •   display battle logs for specified time rage
 
 
This is what is expected from this coding challenge:
    1. Code should be written in PHP or Python
    2. You may use database of your choice
    3. Use of 3rd party framework is allowed
    4. While performance is not critical, you should try to use the BEST practices
 
    Optional Tasks: (But highly recommended)
    1. Create Unit tests to demonstrate that REST API works correctly
    2. Install/deployment script for your coding challenge
    3. use Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
